# 2-7: Stripping Names
# Use a variable to represent a person's name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning
#  and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once.

# Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
# Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(), rstrip(), and strip().

name = "\tGeisa Lopes\n"
print("Unmodified:")
print(name)
print("\nUsing lstrip():")
print(name.lstrip())
print("\nUsing rstrip():")
print(name.rstrip())
print("\nUsing strip():")
print(name.strip())
